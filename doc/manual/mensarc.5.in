.SH NAME
mensarc \- Configuration file for mensa(1)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B $HOME/.mensarc

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mensa
obtains its configuration data from a file called
.IR ".mensarc" "."
This file is located in the user's home directory:

.RS
$HOME/.mensarc
.RE

Individual options can be overridden by specifying the appropriate
setting when running mensa:

.RS
$ mensa <command> <key>=<value> ...
.RE

The mensa configuration file consists of a series of "assignments"
in each line. The "assignments" have the syntax:

.RS
<key>=<value>
.RE

where:
.RS
.TP
<key>
is one of the keys described below

.TP
<value>
is the value the variable is to be set to.
.RE

and set a configuration key to a certain value. The equal sign ("=") is used
to separate the variable name from the value to be set.
Equal signs in the value are allowed.
Leading and trailing whitespaces are ignored.

The hash mark, or pound sign ("#") is used as a "comment" character.
It can be used to annotate the configuration file.
All text after the character to the end of the line is ignored.
No mixed lines are allowed, i.e. if the line starts with an assignment
the hash mark is considered as part of the value.

You can use "yes", "y", "1", "+", "on", "true", "t", "enabled" or
"no", "n", "0", "-", "off", "false", "f", "disabled" to enable or disable a
Boolean setting, respectively.

.SH EDITING
You can edit your .mensarc file by hand if you wish, or you can use the 'config'
command. To permanently set a value in your .mensarc file, use this command:

.RS
$ mensa config <key>=<value> ...
.RE

To unset an entry, use this command:

.RS
$ mensa config <key>= ...
.RE

Note, that this does not delete the assignment.
Currently the only method to achieve this is by manually removing it from .mensarc.

Mensa will also display all your settings with this command:

.RS
$ mensa config
.RE

.SH CONFIGURATION KEYS
Valid key names and their default values are:

.TP
.B cmd.default=show
This is the default command to run, when mensa is invoked without a valid
command name as first argument.

.TP
.B show.date=today
This is the default day to be displayed.
Valid values are "today", "tomorrow", "monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", 
"thursday", "friday", "saturday", "sunday" or a fixed date in the form
YYYY-MM-DD.

.TP
.B show.description=yes
Display the description of the used schema.

.TP
.B show.schema=
The name of the schema to be used.

.TP
.B show.header=Offers for %A, %x
The header to be displayed when invoking the show command.
This string is parsed with
.BR strftime "(3)"
so you can use all the placeholders defined there.
Note that mensa does only care about dates and not about the time.
It is no error to specify a placeholder like %H but the result maybe
not what you want.

.TP
.B show.max-width=80
The width of tables used when ncurses support is not available or to
limit the output length in wider terminals.
Leave the value blank to disable this setting.
Note that this may produce undefined output when ncurses support is
not available.

.SS SCHEMAS

Schemas are referenced by a unique name, defined with the schema-key.
To register a new schema called
.I mymenu
use the following assignment:

.RS
.B schema.mymenu=<path-to-schema-file>
.RE

where
.I <path-to-schema-file>
is a valid path to the appropriate schema file.

You may override the description of the schema (if given) with the
assignment

.RS
.B schema.<name>.description=<description>
.RE
